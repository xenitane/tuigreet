## Features

tuigreet provides a terminal-based authentication interface with session
management, user selection, and power controls. The upstream project includes
session launching from desktop files, username/session persistence, NSS-backed
user menus, themeable UI components, and multi-language support.

This fork, as per its motivation to maintain tuigreet with much-desired features
and stability, extends the original with TOML-based configuration (supporting
both user and system config files with hot-reload), environment variable mapping
for all options, detailed error messages with source context for config issues,
multi-monitor terminal sizing (sizing the TTY to match a specific connected
display via DRM), and exposes core functionality as a library. Some issues that
are fixed from upstream are as follows.

<!-- TODO: this list is incomplete -->

- [tuigreet#156](https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet/issues/156)
- [tuigreet#172](https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet/issues/172)
- [tuigreet#178](https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet/issues/178)
- [tuigreet#190](https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet/issues/190)

Additional, and perhaps marginally less relevant work includes includes a bump
to the Rust edition, MSRV changes, dependency updates, a deep scrub to the
codebase, NixOS VM-based integration tests and other bugfixes such as but not
limited to session wrapper behavior, UID handling, padding semantics, status bar
rendering and so on.

We also port _some_ of the previously open PRs, such as:

- [tuigreet#94](https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet/pull/94)

## Usage

![Screenshot of tuigreet](https://github.com/notashelf/tuigreet/blob/master/contrib/assets/screenshot.png)

The default configuration of tuigreet is quite minimal, visually speaking. It
only displays the authentication prompt and some minor information in the status
bar. You may additionally print your system's `/etc/issue` at the top of the
prompt with `--issue`, and the current date & time using `--time`. The time can
also be customized with the `--time-format` flag. It is also possible to include
a custom, one-line greeting message _instead of_ `/etc/issue` using the
`--greeting` flag.

### Prompt Customization

The initial prompt container will be 80 columns wide. You might want to change
this using the `--width` flag in the case you need more space, e.g., to account
for larger PAM challenge messages. Please refer to usage information (`--help`)
for more customization options. Various padding settings are available through
the `*-padding` options.

### Session Persistence

You can instruct `tuigreet` to remember the last username that successfully
opened a session with the `--remember` option (that way, the username field will
be pre-filled). Similarly, the command and session configuration can be retained
between runs with the `--remember-session` option (when using this, the `--cmd`
value is overridden by manual selections). You can also remember the selected
session per user with the `--remember-user-session` flag. In this case, the
selected session will only be saved on successful authentication.

You may change the command that will be executed after opening a session by
hitting `F2` and amending the command. Alternatively, you can list the
system-declared sessions (or custom ones) by hitting `F3`. Power options are
available through `F12`.

## Install

This fork is currently only packaged for the ArchLinux AUR. Tuigreet is also packaged
in-repo via nix, and you may build from source if you are interested in using
the fork. Should you wish to package this for your distribution, please do, and
submit a pr to update the readme with per-distribution instructions. We will be happy
to review :)

### From Arch Linux

On ArchLinux, two distributions are available from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=tuigreet-fork): `greetd-tuigreet-fork-bin` is the precompiled binary for the latest tagged release and `greetd-tuigreet-fork-git` is available for the same tagged release, but you compile it yourself.
Those can be installed via your preferred AUR helper.
e.g.
```bash
yay -S greetd-tuigreet-fork-bin
```

### With Nix

This fork is not packaged in Nixpkgs, but it is trivial to use the Nixpkgs
derivation with the updated source information, should you wish to run it. For
example, you may create an overlay to override `pkgs.tuigreet` as follows:

```nix
[
  (prev: {
    tuigreet = prev.tuigreet.overrideAttrs {
      src = prev.fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "NotAShelf";
        repo = "tuigreet";
        tag = "0.10.2"; # update this with the tag you want to use
        hash = ""; # update this with the appropriate hash for your tag
      };

      # You will also need to overwrite the hash for cargo dependencies
      cargoHash = "" # update this with the appropriate hash
    };
  }
]
```

Alternatively, you may get it from the flake provided in this repository. In
which case you may use the `default` or `tuigreet` packages. The easiest way of
doing so is creating an overlay as above but point `tuigreet` to
`inputs.tuigreet.packages.${prev.hostPlatform.system}.tuigreet` instead of
overriding the `src`. This will completely replace the derivation, and build
with the correct source automatically. In most cases **this is preferred to
overwriting the Nixpkgs derivation**.

### From source

Building Tuigreet from source requires an installation of Rust's stable
toolchain. Currently 1.90 and above is required. You may use the Nix devshell
provided by the repository, or install it using something like `rustup`.

```sh
# Clone the repository and navigate to it
$ git clone https://github.com/NotAShelf/tuigreet && cd tuigreet

# Build in release mode
$ cargo build --release

# You may then move it to somewhere you can use it. If on NixOS, refer to above
# steps instead of trying to copy the binary.
# $ mv target/release/tuigreet /usr/local/bin/tuigreet
```

> [!NOTE]
> Cache directory must be created for `--remember*` features to work. The
> directory must be owned by the user running the greeter.

```bash
# If cache is missing or owned by the wrong user, you may run the following
# commands to create it, or to fix the permissions.
$ mkdir /var/cache/tuigreet
$ chown greeter:greeter /var/cache/tuigreet
$ chmod 0755 /var/cache/tuigreet
```

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries of `tuigreet` for several architectures can be found in the
[releases](https://github.com/NotAShelf/tuigreet/releases) section of this
repository. The
[tip prerelease](https://github.com/NotAShelf/tuigreet/releases/tag/tip) is
continuously built and kept in sync with the `master` branch.

## Running the tests

Tests from the default features should run without any special consideration by
running `cargo test`.

If you intend to run the whole test suite, you will need to perform some setup.
One of our features uses NSS to list and filter existing users on the system,
and in order not to rely on actual users being created on the host, we use
[libnss_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/nss_wrapper.html) to mock responses from NSS.
Without this, the tests would use the real user list from your system and
probably fail because it cannot find the one it looks for.

```bash
# After installing `libnss_wrapper` on your system (or compiling it to get the`.so`)
# you can run those specific tests as such:
$ export NSS_WRAPPER_PASSWD=contrib/fixtures/passwd
$ export NSS_WRAPPER_GROUP=contrib/fixtures/group
$ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libnss_wrapper.so cargo test --features nsswrapper nsswrapper_ # to run those tests specifically
$ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libnss_wrapper.so cargo test --all-features # to run the whole test suite
```

## Configuration

Edit `/etc/greetd/config.toml` and set the `command` setting to use `tuigreet`:

```toml
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "tuigreet --cmd sway"
user = "greeter"
```

Please refer to [greetd's wiki](https://man.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/greetd/) for
more information on setting up `greetd`.

### TOML Configuration

`tuigreet` supports TOML configuration files in addition to command-line
options. Configuration files are loaded from:

1. `~/.config/tuigreet/config.toml` (user config)
2. `/etc/tuigreet/config.toml` (system config)
3. Custom path via `--config <path>`

Configuration priority: CLI args > environment variables > user config > system
config > defaults

#### Configuration Example

```toml
[display]
show_time = true
greeting = "Welcome to the system!"
align_greeting = "center"
issue = false

[layout]
width = 60
window_padding = 2
container_padding = 1
prompt_padding = 1

[layout.widgets]
time_position = "top"      # "top", "bottom", "default", "hidden"
status_position = "bottom" # "top", "bottom", "default", "hidden"

[remember]
username = true
session = false
user_session = true

[user_menu]
enabled = true
min_uid = 1000
max_uid = 60000

[secret]
mode = "characters"  # "hidden" or "characters"
characters = "*"

[keybindings]
command = 2   # F2
sessions = 3  # F3
power = 12    # F12

[session]
sessions_dirs = ["/usr/share/wayland-sessions", "/usr/share/xsessions"]
xsessions_dirs = []
environments = []

[power]
use_setsid = false

[theme]

time = "blue"
container = "black"
title = "cyan"
greet = "yellow"
prompt = "magenta"
input = "white"
action = "bright-blue"
button = "bright-red"
```

#### Environment Variables

All configuration options can also be set via environment variables. The naming
convention is `TUIGREET_<SECTION>_<KEY>` for nested options, or `TUIGREET_<KEY>`
for top-level options:

```bash
# General configuration
export TUIGREET_DEBUG=true
export TUIGREET_LOG_FILE="/custom/path/tuigreet.log"

# Display options
export TUIGREET_TIME=true
export TUIGREET_TIME_FORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"

# Or use legacy theme format (semicolon-separated)
export TUIGREET_THEME="border=white;text=green;time=blue;container=black"
```

#### Hot Reload

Configuration files are automatically monitored for changes and hot-reloaded
when modified. This allows you to adjust settings without restarting the
greeter.

#### Configuration Errors

tuigreet makes an effort to include detailed context with line numbers and
source code snippets to help identify and fix configuration issues. For example:

```plaintext
TOML parsing error at line 5, column 15:
   4 | [layout]
   5 | width = "invalid_number"
        |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected integer, found string
   6 | window_padding = 2
```

### Multi-monitor Support

On multi-monitor setups the Linux virtual console may span all connected
displays, leaving the greeter rendered across a larger-than-intended area.
tuigreet can resize the TTY to match the native resolution of a specific monitor
by reading connector information from `/sys/class/drm/` and applying the new
dimensions via `TIOCSWINSZ` before the TUI starts.

To see which connectors are available on your system, run:

```sh
tuigreet --list-outputs
```

Then declare the target display in your config. Mark one output `primary = true`
to use it for sizing; if none is marked primary the first enabled entry is used.
Disable any outputs you do not want to affect sizing with `enabled = false`:

```toml
[[outputs]]
connector = "DP-1"
primary = true

[[outputs]]
connector = "HDMI-A-1"
enabled = false
```

If you already know the exact character-cell dimensions you want (e.g. from a
fixed font size), you can bypass the DRM detection entirely with an explicit
override. Both `cols` and `rows` must be provided together:

```toml
[terminal]
cols = 237
rows = 52
```

`[terminal]` takes precedence over `[[outputs]]` when both are set.

### Sessions

The available sessions are fetched from `desktop` files in
`/usr/share/xsessions` and `/usr/share/wayland-sessions`. If you want to provide
custom directories, you can set the `--sessions` arguments with a
colon-separated list of directories for `tuigreet` to fetch session definitions
some other place.

#### Desktop environments

`greetd` only accepts environment-less commands to be used to start a session.
Therefore, if your desktop environment requires either arguments or environment
variables, you will need to create a wrapper script and refer to it in an
appropriate desktop file.

For example, to run X11 Gnome, you may need to start it through `startx` and
configure your `~/.xinitrc` (or an external `xinitrc` with a wrapper script):

```plaintext
exec gnome-session
```

To run Wayland Gnome, you would need to create a wrapper script akin to the
following:

```bash
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland dbus-run-session gnome-session
```

Then refer to your wrapper script in a custom desktop file (in a directory
declared with the `-s/--sessions` option):

```plaintext
Name=Wayland Gnome
Exec=/path/to/my/wrapper.sh
```

#### Common wrappers

Two options allows you to automatically wrap run commands around sessions
started from desktop files, depending on whether they come
`/usr/share/wayland-sessions` or `/usr/share/xsessions`: `--sessions-wrapper`
and `--xsessions-wrapper`. With this, you can prepend another command on front
of the sessions you run to set up the required environment to run these kinds of
sessions.

By default, unless you change it, all X11 sessions (those picked up from
`/usr/share/xsessions`) are prepended with `startx /usr/bin/env`, so the X11
server is started properly.

### Power management

Two power actions are possible from `tuigreet`, shutting down (through
`shutdown -h now`) and rebooting (with `shutdown -r now`) the machine. This
requires that those commands be executable by regular users, which is not the
case on some distros.

To alleviate this, there are two options that can be used to customize the
commands that are run: `--power-shutdown` and `--power-reboot`. The provided
commands must be non-interactive, meaning they will not be able to print
anything or prompt for anything. If you need to use `sudo` or `doas`, they will
need to be configured to run passwordless for those specific commands.

An example for `/etc/greetd/config.toml`:

```toml
[default_session]
command = "tuigreet --power-shutdown 'sudo systemctl poweroff'"
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all commands are prefixed with `setsid` to completely detach the
> command from our TTY. If you would prefer to run the commands as is, or if
> `setsid` does not exist on your system, you can use `--power-no-setsid`.

### User menu

Optionally, a user can be selected from a menu instead of typing out their name,
with the `--user-menu` option, this will present all users returned by NSS at
the time `tuigreet` was run, with a UID within the acceptable range. The values
for the minimum and maximum UIDs are selected as follows, for each value:

- A user-provided value, through `--user-menu-min-uid` or `--user-menu-max-uid`;
- **Or**, the available values for `UID_MIN` or `UID_MAX` from
  `/etc/login.defs`;
- **Or**, hardcoded `1000` for minimum UID and `60000` for maximum UID.

### Theming

[in the ratatui repository]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/ratatui-core/src/style/color.rs

A theme specification can be given through the `--theme` argument to control
some of the colors used to draw the UI. This specification string must have the
following format: `component1=color;component2=color[;...]` where the component
is one of the value listed in the table below, and the color is a valid ANSI
color name as listed [in the ratatui repository].

Mind that the specification string include semicolons, which are command
delimiters in most shells, hence, you should enclose it in single-quotes so it
is considered a single argument instead.

Please note that we can only render colors as supported by the running terminal.
In the case of the Linux virtual console, those colors might not look as good as
one may think. Your mileage may vary.
